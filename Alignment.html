It is possible to automatically attain a good alignment upon character creation based on the species selection and the background they possess. Additionally, adopting moral choices, such as the act of sparing a defeated adversary out of compassion, can result in a shift towards a good alignment. However, the act of unlawfully ending the life of another who also adheres to a good or neutral alignment will change one's own alignment to that of evil."</i></b></span>

Upon character creation, a player can automatically attain the neutral alignment depending on their choice of species and its background within the game. Adopting a neutral stance yields no benefits or drawbacks, yet it presents a significant challenge when attempting to complete the entire game. Because players would need to consistently make decisions that align with the neutral path, which unfortunately brings neither advantages nor disadvantages. This makes it beneficial to choose alignments that offer unique benefits or rewards."</i></b></span>

A character can automatically gain the evil alignment upon spawning into the game, influenced by their species and background selection. Another way to become evil is through making unrighteous decisions, such as eliminating an adversary who has been vanquished in battle. Even if an evil-aligned person takes the life of another person who also follows the evil path, their alignment will not change. Several methods exist within the game to transition from an evil alignment to a good one through possessing specific items, utilizing unique skills, and making key storytelling choices."</i></b></span>
